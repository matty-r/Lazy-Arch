# arch-build
### About

Created because I install Arch Linux on almost all of my PCs (Desktops, Laptops, VMs), and I wanted a way to automate the boring stuff - such as partitioning, installing a DE with it's packages, and setting up a boot loader. With that said, this script may not work as intended for everybody, and it's still very much a work in progress.

### Contributing

There are a lot of Arch Linux install scripts out there, but if you think you'd like to help then I won't stop you - the more the merrier.

### Usage

* Clone the GitHub repository onto your local drive
* Edit arch-build.sh (if needed) with the appropriate bundles you need
* Set arch-build.sh to executable
